=head1 NAME

STORE_CTX, STORE_post_process_info_fn, STORE_open_file, STORE_open,
STORE_load, STORE_eof, STORE_close - Types and functions to read
objects from a URI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/store.h>
 
 typedef struct store_ctx_st STORE_CTX;

 typedef STORE_INFO *(*STORE_post_process_info_fn)(STORE_INFO *, void *);

 STORE_CTX *STORE_open_file(const char *path, const UI_METHOD *ui_method,
                            void *ui_data,
                            STORE_post_process_info_fn post_process,
                            void *post_process_data);
 STORE_CTX *STORE_open(const char *uri, pem_password_cb *pw_callback,
                       void *pw_callback_data);
 STORE_INFO *STORE_load(STORE_CTX *ctx);
 int STORE_eof(STORE_CTX *ctx);
 int STORE_close(STORE_CTX *ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions help the application to fetch supported objects (see
L<STORE_INFO(3)/SUPPORTED OBJECTS> for information on which those are)
from a given URI (see L</SUPPORTED SCHEMES> for more information on
the supported URI schemes).
The general method to do so is to "open" the URI using STORE_open(),
read each available and supported object using STORE_load() as long as
STORE_eof() hasn't been reached, and finish it off with STORE_close().

The retrieved information is store in a B<STORE_INFO>, which is further
described in L<STORE_INFO(3)>.

=head2 Types

B<STORE_CTX> is a context variable that holds all the internal
information for STORE_open(), STORE_load(), STORE_eof() and
STORE_close() to work together.

=head2 Functions

STORE_open_file() takes a file path B<path>, password UI method
B<ui_method> with associated data B<ui_data>, and post processing
callback B<post_process> with associated data B<post_process_data>,
opens the path and returns a B<STORE_CTX> with all necessary internal
information.
The given B<ui_method> and B<ui_data_data> will be reused by all
functions that use B<STORE_CTX> when a password is needed.
The given B<post_process> and B<post_process_data> will be reused by
STORE_load() to manipulate or drop the value to be returned.
This is STORE_open()'s little brother to handle cases where the file
name has characters that aren't acceptable in a URI, such as the
backslash used in Windows paths.

STORE_open() takes a URI B<uri> and the same password UI method and
result post processing callbacks as STORE_open_file(), opens a
channel to the data located at that URI and returns a B<STORE_CTX>
with all necessary information.

STORE_eof() takes a B<STORE_CTX> and checks if we've reached the end
of data.

STORE_load() takes a B<STORE_CTX>, tries to load the next available
object and return it wrapped with  B<STORE_INFO>.

STORE_close() takes a B<STORE_CTX>, closes the channel that was opened
by STORE_open() and frees all other information that was stored in the
B<STORE_CTX>, as well as the B<STORE_CTX> itself.

=head1 SUPPORTED SCHEMES

The basic supported scheme is B<file:>.
Any other scheme can be added dynamically, using
STORE_register_loader().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

STORE_open_file(), STORE_open() and STORE_load() return a pointer to a
B<STORE_CTX> on success, B<NULL> on failure.

STORE_eof() returns 1 if the end of data has been reached, otherwise
0.

STORE_close() returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.
